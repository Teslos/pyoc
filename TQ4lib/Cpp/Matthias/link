#
# You must have compiled the OC software 
# to obtain liboceq.a and liboceqplus.mod
# These files are copied here together with
# the F90 source library liboctq.F90 
# liboctqisoc.F90 is the OC/TQ library that can be called from C++

# The copy commands assume we are at 
# TQ4lib/Cpp/isoC-matthias/ below OC
cp ../../../liboceq.a .
cp ../../../liboceqplus.mod .

# This is the same for library for F90 and C++
cp ../liboctq.F90 .
gfortran -c liboctq.F90

# This library calls the F90 library
gfortran -c liboctqisoc.F90

# This is linking all together
g++ -g -L/usr/local/gfortran/lib -o tqcpptest1 -lstdc++ tqcpptest1.cpp liboctqisoc.o liboctq.o liboceq.a -lgfortran -lm
