@$ Now insulate the system for heat exchange
@$ that is done by changing the condition on T to enthalpy

l r 1

@$ This is the stable tie-line between FCC and BCC
@$ (Ortho-equilibrium) when BCC has x(cr)=.2.  FCC has less Cr 
@$ and its x(c)=.032961.  Now we want to find the NPLE
@$ composition of C in FCC (when FCC has the same Cr content
@$  as BCC and the current chemical potential for C)
@& 
@$--------------------------------------------------------------
@$ To calculate this remove the bcc phase and calculate with just
@$ the FCC with the same Cr content as bcc, x(fcc,cr)=.2 for the
@$ same carbon activity.  That is NPLE conditions for growing FCC

set status phase bcc_a2=d
set status phase fcc_a1=ent 1
set c ac(c)

set c x(c)=none x(bcc_a2,cr)=none
set c x(fcc,cr)=.2

@&

c n

l,,,,

@$ This is the content of C in an FCC with same Cr fraction
@$ as BCC and with the same carbon activity as the tie-line.
@$ The carbon content in FCC is now x(c)=.030725
@$ We are inside the two-phase region as BCC would like to be
@$ stable (it has a small positive driving force, +4.90E-4) but
@$ it is dormant and cannot be included in the stable phase set.
