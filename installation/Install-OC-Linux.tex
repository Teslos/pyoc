{\Large \bf Installation of OpenCalphad on Linux}

Bo Sundman, \today

\end{center}

There is no automatic installation routine for OC, you must download
and compile the software yourself.  You may also have to install
Fortran compilers and the GNUPLOT software if you do not already have
them.  The OC development team cannot offer you any help for that,
please ask some local experts if you need help.

The descrcipton below applies when installing OC on a ``vanilla''
Linux system, the guides available are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Install-OC-Windows-MinGW
\item Installation de OC sous Windows avec Cygwin (in French)
\item Install-OC-Linux
\end{itemize}

Step by step installation:

\begin{itemize}
\item The code is written in the new Fortran standard and requires a
  compiler like GNU Fortran 4.8 or similar.

\item Normally you have the GNU Fortran compiler in your linux system
  otherwise you can get the GNU Fortran suite free from
  https://SourgeForge.net or some similar site.  If you have Intel or
  another Fortran compiler you must be sure it is compatible with GNU
  Fortran 4.8 or later.

\item Rename the file ``Makefile-sequential'' to Makefile

\item If you have access to several CPUs you can test OC with
  parallelization using Open MP.  In that case you should rename
  ``Makefile-parallel'' to Makefile

\item open a terminal window and use ``cd'' (change directory) to the
  direcory where you unzipped OC.  Type ``make'' to run the Makefile.
  {\bf If you have errors running the make command files please
    contact a local expert.}

\item For the graphics you must download and install the free GNUPLOT
  software, for example from SoureForge.

  Make sure your PATH includes the directory with the GNUPLOT program.
  If you do not know how to set your PATH ask a local expert.

\item Creating a home directory for OC
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Create a directory called OCHOME, usually at your home
    directory ``mkfile OCHOME''
    
  \item Copy the file ochelp.hlp to this directory

  \item Create an environment variable called OCHOME with the parth
    to your OCHOME directory.  If you do not know how create an
    environment variable please as a local expert.

  \item Later you may also add a macro file called ``start.OCM''
    that you want to run everytime you start OC on this directory.
    You can also create a subdirectory called ``databases'' that you
    can search when you give the command ``read tdb'' in OC if you
    prefix the file name by ``ocbase/''
  \end{itemize} 

\item Look in ``after-installation'' for help using OC.

\end{itemize}

You are welcome to help providing a better installation guide also!
